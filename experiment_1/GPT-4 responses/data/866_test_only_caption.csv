She used to think I was the center of the universe.
I remember the day that Mars said “You’ll regret being habitable”
Could I get some more ice?
It's five o'clock somewhere.
Everything I drink goes to my equator.”
I'll take another hurricane.
"Excuse me, but there's plastic in my water."
I have to watch what I drink—I’m bipolar.
"Another double please, I’m having a global crisis over here!"
"No, you’re the one spinning."
"Lenny, you ever wake up one day and realize you're just not as cool as you were 100 years ago?"
How does it feel to be the world’s favorite bartender?
I used to be a lot cooler.
Do you accept carbon credits?
I was cool with moonogamy until I met Jupiter.
Work's been crazy - I've been on a non-stop rotation 24/7!
"The sun? Ugh, that guy thinks everything revolves around him."
"Aw, I’m already polluted."
I don't even know where to start. I have about 7 billion problems...
You ever think about where you'll be in five years?
"Oh so thirsty, 96.5% ocean and not a drop to drink"
I woulda given her the world!
I only drink bottled water.
Could use a little more ice please.
Cut me off if the room stops spinning.
Just give me something that will help me forget the hot flashes
"I’m telling you Bob, these people are killing me."
Now she's complaining I'm TOO hot!
I've got stage 4 humans
Life was better during the Paleozoic.
"Actually, the moon is a real asshole."
"On the rocks, please. Lots of them."
"I'm telling ya, what goes around, comes around."
I could use some more ice.
I just feel like I'm going in circles.
"What do you mean last call, I'm just warming up."
Earth to bartender!
"Her name was Venus. She was so hot, but she traveled in different circles."
Is it just me or is it getting warmer around here?
Seriously? Do I look Flat to you?
Is it me or is the room spinning?
"Yeah, Venus is hot, but she's way out of my orbit."
This place could use a little atmosphere.
"Wait, you don’t have any ice either?"
"I feel Ike I work so hard, and at the end of the year I’m back where I started.”"
"Don’t worry, the Sun’s gravity is my designated driver."
You don't know what it's like to be a small world after all.
My problem is that Republicans don't understand me.
"On second thought, forget the drink, gimme more ice!"
Can I get two more? I only face this way once a day.
"Worst date ever! She claimed that I was actually flat, and just contorting myself to fit some UN world order narrative."
"No thanks, I’ll pass. The room is spinning!"
This place has no atmosphere.
So you're losing your hair? I'm losing my ozone layer!
Can I get more ice? Mine is melting.
And then things started to get heated…
She said I was hot and left.
Venus is hot but out of my orbit.
I feel like I've just been going round in circles.
I’m done with the cosmos. Give me a whiskey.
"She was my universe, man."
I'm a hot mess.
"You spend billions of years to get it right, then they stumble upon the Industrial Revolution and arrogantly think they know how to do better and, in a blink of an eye,  phhtt!"
"Is it me, or is it getting hotter in here everyday?"
You didn’t know the earth was a heavy drinker? I didn’t know the moon was a nosy bartender.
It's always five o'clock somewhere.
My ice melted again.
"They scoffed at me when I told them about my invisible friend; now ""dark matter"" is all they can talk about."
Give me all the ice you have.
I’m so fracked.
And then I told her that the world doesn't revolve around her.
"Doesn't it feel warm in here?"""
I'll  give you a hundred bucks for 5 minutes in the walk-in.
"If I had any idea, I would never have allowed them to land in the first place."
I suspect he is seeing other planets.
"Oh, boo-hoo. ‘I’ haven’t had a vacation in 4 billion years!"
I ever tell you about me and Pluto?
Welcome to my world.
It’s been a long day.
Why is there plastic in my drink?
I feel like I'm taken for granite
Sometimes I feel like I have the weight of me on my shoulders.
I just came in to cool off.
Have you ever felt like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders?
Let's be honest - I miss the dinosaurs.
My moon doesn't understand me.
And I can never figure out where to go on vacation!
…I’m actually not a people person.
You think you've got problems!? I gotta be carbon neutral by 2037!
"If I’m here, what are you standing on?!"
"I’ve got a good one: Mars, Earth, and Elon walk into a bar…"
Why do I drink?  Have you seen the news lately?
Have you run out of ice too?
No! I'm just a marble.
She told me she needed some space
I need another round to get through the day
What ID? I am older than dirt.
"I'm 4.5 Billion years old--and 70% water, just like your drinks."
My drink is flat.
I tell you these changes I'm going through are not natural!
I'm just warming up.
Who cares if I'm flat or round? Can't I just be loved for who I am?
"Hey, I need some ice"
I'm sick of people.
So then I find out that my brother 'Pluto' isn't really my brother at all!
Can I get some ice with that?
"Just like me, your drinks are 71% water."
"Get me some ice in this, I’m burning up!"
"Can you crank up the A/C, please? My ice caps are melting."
I said  I want global cooling.
I had it all.  Everything revolved around me until Copernicus shows up.
"Mercury and Venus, don't get me started."
"So she says to me,”why is it so hard to get to your core?”"
Would humans say Mars is flat if they lived there?
"I gotta tell ya, they're killing me."
"I tell ya, man — my inhabitants just don’t understand me."
"Anything cool, please--I'm warming."
"When I asked him who besides him was going to carry me, Atlas shrugged."
"So I says, “I’ll tell you what the world is coming to!”"
Make it look like an accident.
You’d drink too if you had my problems.
"You call it ""blacking out,"" I call it an eclipse."
Any more worldly advice?
"Could I get some more ice,please?"
"Trust me, alcohol is the least of my problems."
"You’d think I’d be flattered, but I just don’t want to be this hot!"
...but that's just my world view
another round please
All I can say is I tried.
"Next thing I knew, Atlas shrugged."
"Have a few drinks, have a few laughs, I mean what could go wrong?"
Last call? I'm just warming up!
I never get drunk because I'm mostly water.
....And Republicans seem surprised that I'm not flat.
"Listen, I’m not flat and I do have an end!"
You wouldn't believe the century I've had!
"I have been taking care of you, please take care of me."
No more. I'm spinning already.
"I swear, Pluto's not mine."
"I'm a small world after all."""
"Next thing I know, I've been mooned."""
I'm over 14 billion years old. How about a little respect!
"Yeah, one more please, I’m feeling kind of flat today."
My wife and I are worlds apart.
They want me to drink methane too!
Global warming has really got me down
Is it just me or is the room spinning?
"The world keeps changing: it’s sphere today, gone tomorrow."
You don't have any ice either?
Are you sure this is 97% salt water?
And then she called me geocentric...can you believe that?
Whadja put in this? My head's spinning!!!
Mind adjusting AC? I’m a bit too warm.
I can't abide these hot flashes anymore.
"My children give me Earth Day, but what about the rest of the year?"
I’m drunk off my axis.”  “Where is the restroom? Gotta go drain the ole south pole
…so she says ‘ you my friend live in a world of your own’…
"I’m telling ya man, there’s these little things crawling all over me!"
I really just need Water.
Could you please turn down the thermostat?
"It wasn’t a conference after all. It was an intervention! Mars, Venus…everyone said I’ve changed and not for the better."
I'll have large  cup of COOLADE!
"I feel like I just keep going around in circles."""
"This drink isn't carbonated, is it?"
"I’m gonna need, like, waaay more ice in this."
I just get this feeling no one will ever really know what's at my core.
Do you ever feel like your just going around in circles?
"Yeah, I was the source for drilling all that oil, but it was never my idea to burn it!"
And you really believe that someday there will be a happy hour again?
What in the world is happening to me...?
My ice keeps melting.
I still miss the Ice Age.
"My ex was the best...very religious...looked at me like I was only 5,000"
I'm so hot I'm gonna need an ice age to cool off!
He said it like a “globalist” is a bad thing.
I feel like I got my own weight on my shoulders!
"Sure, I'd love to leave the Solar System, but I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation."
It ain't right Gus.  After four billion years together Mother Nature packs up and moves in with her sister in Jersey.
No ice?
"Last call, it's only 2023?!"
For me it's one revolution after another.
"Another frozen mojito, please ... and could you turn the AC down one-and-a-half degrees Celsius?"
I don’t just have the world on my shoulders; I am the world.
Does it look like it's receding?
Just hand me the bottle.  I'm always five o'clock somewhere.
They never ever ask how I feel...and the things they say!
Last call? Tell me about it...
What’s happened to the atmosphere in this place?
"Every day is Earth Day on this barstool, Fred."
Atlas left me.
"It’s a wonderful world, it’s a wonderful world…how many times a day is that song played…??” “Do you know the pressure I’m under???"
You don't have to tell me we're out of ice!
Evolve!  I should 've stopped  with the chimps.
Can you turn down the heat?  It’s like a greenhouse in here.
One small drink for me and a large one for the end  of mankind!
There was room for ice.
And then I dreamed they were crawling all over me and buzzing around me and...it was just awful.
I think this place needs a bit more atmosphere.
This is the kind of atmosphere I've been needing.
No more Fireballs.
On top of that I have plate tectonics.
Do you want to go rotate after this?
Why do people walk all over me?
I have enough water as it is.
You think you have troubles! I'll be Andromeda dust in just 5 billion years.
"I just feel like I've got the weight of humanity on my shoulders, you know?"
I’ll be back in the same spot tomorrow.
Just make it look like we're talking - Pluto's here.
I am so lonely since Pluto went away.
Lots more ice in my next one. I have to cool off fast.
"I just need to cool down, yah know?"
"You’re 70% water, too - don’t you get thirsty?"
Make it a double. Mercury's in retrograde!
"My life revolves around her, do you know what I mean!?!"
I get blamed for everything.
Whaddya got to cool me down?
"And then he says ""Don't go changing"", like it's up to me!"
"I swear Joe, it's like they don't even care!"
"Joe,I had the world on a string"
I miss the good-old days when I was Gaia.
Everything was great for 4 1/2 billion years.
"It's been a long day. Make it a double!"""
You think you've seen some fucked up humans...
I swear I only drink this much when I’m overheated
"no matter what i do, i can't seem to shake this fever"
"My temperature keeps rising, and no one seems to care!"
Even Atlas has given up on me.
Thanks for solving all of my problems.
They're killing me...
The “X” man has got me by the ass!
I’ve been experiencing an untreatable fever lately.
"And the next thing you know, I’m seeing satellites circling!"
"Is it hot in here,or is it your imagination?"
The doctor said I have about 8 billion parasites.
"If it’s my wife, I’m not a sphere."
"My doctor keeps telling me to cut back on fossil fuels,but who can afford clean energy in this economy!"
"Yes, people always mistake me for Gorbachev."
"Trust me, it's five o'clock somewhere."
"I turn around and around, there she is again–beaming at me."
Being called flat hurts.  It really hurts.
"And that's when I said, ""I don't care about Uranus, show me your moon."""
"Everyone always asks me, 'What's this world coming to?'"
I just feel like my life is going in circles.
''All anybody wants to talk about is the weather.''
Have you seen my pants?!
My ice is melting.  Can you refresh me?
I need a cold one. I've never been this hot!
"It's last call for me, so just leave the bottle."
"Please, Sir.  Can I have more ice? I’m trying to cool off."
"Then, they invented something called MILF island…"
Then she says “you’re not worldly enough”. Can you believe that?
Could you please turn the heat down a degree? I'm melting.
Screw it— give me a plastic straw.
This eco disaster has driven me to drink
"Hey, it’s hotter can you turn on the AC in here?"
A round for everyone please.
And THEN they started burning this thing called coal
My name is NOT Sherwin Williams!
Give me one goddam reason not to tell the Moon to get lost!
I don’t know why she left - I thought talking about global warming would be a good icebreaker.
"Evidently, I'm in a world of trouble."
My southern hemisphere is hemorrhoidal!
"Hey Mac, all my ice melted."
"I prefer to be stirred, not shaken."
Whaddaya mean you're out of ice?
Give me a heads up if any more humans come in.
No thanks. After one drink my head starts spinning and everyone gets dizzy!
Got any more ice?
You got anything non-carbonated?
"Hey, Fred, could I get a few million cubic yards of ice?"
Clearly we don’t have the same worldview!
Ice on the rocks. Please.
Here’s an idea. Play some Perry Como once in awhile.
I like this bar because it is so down to earth.
Do you have something for a headache.
"Continental drift is bad enough, but this incontinental drip is really killing me."
"And I said, “Your shoulders? What about what’s on my shoulders for god’s sake?” -Wade Munday, Nashville, Tenn"
Everybody’s giving me a hard time! YOU’D have hot flashes too if you were 4.5 billion years old!
I'm over-heating here. I need a Scotch on the rocks - but hold the Scotch
Do you ever feel like the weight of world is on your shoulders?
"I could really use another ice cube, they keep melting!"
She complains that I am too distant.
Venus just doesn't get me.
And then she said “you better just cool off”!
I was a cool calm planet until I crossed global warning's path.
"No,No,I need a LOT of water!"
How big is your ice machine?
"I don't push they other planets away, but I never let them get closer to me, either."
And do they really think that nammg a day after me makes up for all the crap I have to put up with?
Do you have any more of this clean water back there? I'm running low.
"If the Moon calls looking for me, I'm not here."
My doctor says I’m bipolar.
"I thought I said, ""No carbon."""
"I'll take a Hurricane, an Earthquake, and a Mudslide, please."
"With the dinosaurs, I swear I only drank on weekends"
Is it just me or has the whole place gone to hell?
I’ve got something called homo-sapien-carcinoma.  I don’t think I’m going to make it.  I should have been born outside the inhabitable zone.
"She liked my magnetism, but didn’t like that I was bipolar."
We go on one date and poof! I never hear from Pluto again.
She said we’re polar opposites.
Will you call a cab so I can get out of here?
I can't stand it! I'm getting trashed
"In his hands"", ""On his shoulders"" - I'm sick of being handled"
I'll stop drinking when they are all polluting Mars.
"I would wear sunglasses at this point,but you know,no ears."
I used to be a glass half full kind of planet.
Could I have one more for the orbit?
''She said I wasn't edgy enough.''
Another one of those and my world will be spinning.
Where do I go if George Soros gives up on me?
This is what the world has come to.
Do you have lots of ice? Because I think I'm gonna need lots of ice.
All that drinking and now my sea levels have risen. I'm a goner.
It's way too warm here -- I need some ice.
"My life is just a never-ending 'Shake, Rattle, and Roll'."
"I was able to handle the stress of my plate tectonics for eons, but these damn rising sea levels have driven me to drink."
You wouldn’t believe the day I’ve had.
Will this make the world go away?
My asteroid belt makes me look fat so I am thinking of switching to asteroid suspenders.
"Pour me a double, boss, they told me I only got twelve years."
Line ‘em up Sam.  It’s gonna be a long story with a sad ending.
Put it on humanity's tab.
You hiring? I think my current gig is just about up.
"How would you feel if everyone called you, “messed up?”"
Another one on ice… I really need to cool down
You should have seen the rings on her
"It's like I said. They'll be sorry when they discover they don't have me to kick around anymore."""
"So I said, ‘If it’s a hoax, they sure fooled me.’"
Make it on the rocks; the heat is really getting to me.
Make it a double. A strong double.
"No more thanks, I am already seeing two moons."
I don't know why everyone keeps saying that. It's NOT a stage.
Would it be presumptuous to ask for Moonshine?
"Don't kill the messenger, but Ireland is asking for something a wee bit stronger."
and then the guy bet me a drink that i was flat
How about an ice cube?
Doc says 5 years. I’m saying I have another  ice age in me.
My glass is definitely half empty.
"So Planet Earth walks into a bar and says, “I'll have something non-carbonated.”"
"God, I hate people."
"Shakiness, flooding, overheating, maybe it's menopause?"
I said ice water!
I only drink when Mercury is in retrograde
You ever feel like your life is just going around in circles?
Earth calling! I'm running dry over here!
I guess it’s time to close out my tab.
I'm polluted.
I'll go another round
I haven't felt the need to drink since the ice age.
"Basically, I’m a hot mess."
"Doc says my high temperatures and chills are due to an imbalance in my macrobiome,whatever that means. Plus I’m really greenhouse gassy lately."
Could I get something non-carbonated?
I'm a glass half-full kind of planet
I can't wait till Musk sends you all to Mars.
More ice.
I just need my space.
Panic Cocktail please! with ice on top and bottom only.
"For years,I had it practically all to myself and then this wise guy Hobbs comes along!"
"Do I have to do everything around here? I mean, can a mother get a little help?"
When do the pole dancers start?
Hey Bud if world peace were that easy I wouldn’t need this drink!
Surprise me .
"The bar-sign said ""Ice Cold Beer!"""
"Hey, buddy, I need more ice...a whole lot more ice, here!"
Whoa. Now I'm really spinning.”
I’ve got this infection called people and it’s killing me
Keep the drinks coming until I’m in retrograde
"What IS so funny about peace, love, and understanding?"
"If my life calls, I'm not here."
"Being the third of eight I don’t get much attention but as you’ve heard, I could use some help."
"Bartender: Say, we don't get many planets in here. Earth: And at these prices — plus global warming, of course — you won't get many more."
Could you show me the way to the next solar system
One more for the orbit.
Global warming makes me thirsty.
Hit me again...I'm feelin' a little shaky.
The world's no place for a guy like me.
It’s always something.
"So it turns out, my brother's hiding behind the sun all this time."
Global warming my ass.  It’s herpes and some purple-haired tree hugger gave it to me.
Ice quick! I’m burning up over here!
"Make it a double, I’m dying."
"It's all Mars, Mars, Mars -- no one cares about old Earth anymore!"
This is my last one. My head is spinning.
I remember when they came down from the trees like it was yesterday.
"Just a cold one please,"
You try being dropped by a Titan.
I feel like I've got the weight of me on my shoulders.
"So, a star walks into a bar..."
"""All my homo sapiens have gone out of their ever-loving minds."
Sometimes I just feel like I’m in someone else’s shadow.
I'm feeling a little warm -- you sure this stuff's environmentally friendly?
"Ever since I realized Lin-Manuel Miranda lives on me,it's sent me into an alcohol fueled depression. I also never really fully processed 9/11."
Just like everyone else:  no one will listen.
NO! That's the thing. I'm just a randomly colored sphere with a drinking problem.
"Wiki defines me as a 'washed up  cliché'!"""
I gave Atlas my key -- has he been in here lately?
I just feel like I am being pulled in all different directions.
They tell me “Hang on Humpty Dumpty”
How about a glass of ice?
"Pardon me, I'm hot and really need to Crack A Cold One."
"I think that the Moon stood me up again"""
May I have some ice? I think I’m going through climate change!
Sometimes I just wish an asteroid would come along and put me out of my misery!
Do you know what's like when they say 'the whole world is watching?'
Check please. It's been a long day.
"A fire, a tornado, and a hurricane walk into a bar....ah, never mind."""
That was tough when he had the whole of me in his hands.
I think the planet deserves a good stiff  drink
Goodbye cruel bar.
"I never wanted to get divorced, but Sunny thought my life should revolve around her!"
I’ve got the weight of some guy on my shoulders!
I said neat. Do I look like I need more water?
Look at me...and they keep sayin' it's just a hoax!
"Wait, I ordered a Cosmos"
I just caught 7 other planets circling my beloved sunshine!
"It’s your fault, you know."
"I ordered a DOUBLE  Long Drink, Sir"
Is this filtered??
Being the host of parasitic humans has nearly ruined me. That’s why I drink.
"Keep 'em coming, I'm two thirds water!"
"It's hard to resist, when it's always 5:00 somewhere in the world."
"Well, if I rotate the other way a little bit, then it won’t be closing time. So, just chill and let me finish my story."
"I tell you, I'm dying, and too few give a shit!"
It's either a melanoma or plate tectonics.
Better bring me the bottle.
Why do people insist on talking about my weight?
Then she sez 'you got cooties! Eight billion of them!'
"I just need an unexhaustable supply of cool, clear water."
"God, Nobody listens to me."
"Nah, seriously!  I'm in a whole world of hurt. or Don't look at me like that.  My crisis is everybody's crisis!"
"Thanks,Sam. Guess I'll be wobbling off now."
"Is it me, or is it getting too hot in here?"
"Another ice water, please. And make it a triple shot."
The earth wants to talk to the bartender
Who is this 'Atlas' guy anyway?
"Thanks for listening, it means the world to me."
WHO just fired me.
I've been a globalist forever but why are people upset about it now?
"I won't be here for long, so make the next one a double."
She said I was her whole world.
...and then I found out the Moon is seeing other planets.
I’ve seen the dark side of the moon.
"So set'em up,Joe,I have a little story I think you should know."
Earth: “Bourbon on the rocks” Bartender: “We are out of ice” Earth: “Same”
Seriously men! I have fleas  … Look! Look! … they walk all over!
"Ya know,some days I feel like I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders."
Excuse me can I use the bathroom? I have diarrhea.
Am I looking a little round to you?
Can you point me somewhere that isn’t Last Chance Saloon?
"You'll tell when I've had enough, right?"
"The world does not revolve around you, Sam."
Can I have some ice caps?
Have any ice?  Mine is melting.
Do you know what it's like to have the weight of the world on your shoulders?
"More ice, please. I'm dying here."
I need a cold one!
Can I have some ice?
A little ice?
I've been talking about UFO's for centuries!
What I really need now is love sweet love.
I just wanna cool down a bit.
It's like all the good single ladies have disappeared into a black hole!
"It's getting so bad here, I am thinking of changing orbits"
"Im going through the change, hot flashes and all."
"Yeah,I know…I look like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders."
"Sorry, my bad... Volcanoes."
"...Really, I'm just tired of being orbited! They keep pulling on my tides like I wont notice..."
Heard the one about the climate denialist and the flat-earther who walked into a bar together?
I’ve got the weight of my shoulders on my shoulders.
"Is it me, or is it getting hotter in here?"
"It's not like I want to spew lava and spawn tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes, but you people are killing me"
"OMG,the whole World has gone crazy"
You think old age has been cruel to you?
I’ve never felt so down to earth
"No more ice, ever?!"
I've been aching for over a year in my Russian area.
"My twin--oh, Venus! We're on the same orbit but how come we're not able to hang out?"
"One minute it's chills, then shakes, then fever. And boy have I been windy lately."
It all started in the Mesozoic era...
I’m a mess …!
"I'm telling you Joe, I get no RESPECT!"
New World Order ing
One more ‘continental drift ‘ please.
Hey. Can a fella get something to help him cool off around here?
"Please don't say, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
Why would He put me here and then cover me with this fungus that I call humanity?
"Everybody has problems, but I'm always in a world of trouble."
"Its hot, and I am feeling bloated.  What is going on around here?"
Make it a double with ice cubes.
WHAT  IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?
"If it’s not too much trouble, can you spare more ice?"
You know what gets me hot? People that don't think I'm hot.
"Ah, we are way past the glass half full or empty with this one. There will be no glass."
It’s just nice to have someone that listens to you.
"I'm telling you, I've had enough."
It's feels like I'm the weight on someone's shoulders
It's *constantly* five o'clock somewhere!
"Man, if you were me you’d see this cup as half empty too!"
What harm is one drink going to do.  I've already been polluted with toxic waste!!
I'll take one more for the skillet.
I stopped the world to let people off!
I need another. Got the world on my shoulders!
"I ordered it ""on-the-rocks"", I'm having hot flashes!"
Do you have aanything colder?
"Some of my best friends are ""Flat Earthers""..."
Climate change; you can’t live with it and and can’t foresee a century without it.
You ran out of ice?
"With ice! No matter how much I blow off steam, I can’t seem to cool off."
Could you wack on the air conditioning?
"My brother, Earth, just passed away."
"I swear, Herb, these people are going to be the death of me."
Don't you  get tired of people thinking they can walk all over you?
"She left me because she said my head was too round, and she wanted a guy with a flattop."
"Man, is it hot enough for ya?"
"From  now on it's going to be the priest, the rabbi and the planet"
I'm going to need alot of ice!
It can't be last call.
"Pluto? Oh, he's no longer in my circle. You know, I didn't completely disagree when he chastised me for getting around. But I knew our relationship was over when he said I was spinning out of control."
Can you turn on the air conditioner?
First world problems
D’ya have any idea what it’s like to be me?
What's to say? It's been another helluva week here!
"Could I get another water, I'm really over heating."
"...and then she left me!  Went to 'colonize' my neighbor. What's he got that I don't, anyway?"
Everybody seems to think they know how to “solve the world’s problems.”
"What do you mean, you’re also running out of  ice?"
Got anything with ice in it?
"My ice is melting, can you turn it down a bit."
Problems? Problems?  Where do you want me to start?
"Mars?!  I'm telling you, what's a planet got to do to get some respect?"
How 'bout a round of eight billion.
"I just don't feel like he's got the ""whole me"" in his hands!"
Political Climate Change
You don’t know what it’s like to live every day with a nasty case of the spins”
"And then , that guy, the moon, hit me!"
"Look mack, I've been around the block and I can tell you this global warming shit is for real."
It all started when I was born.
"...And then, I top of all that, I feel like my life is spinning out of control !!!"
"Sorry bud, but I’m gonna need waaay more ice."
"Hey buddy, can I get another hurricane over here?"
Can we skip 'Last Call' for another time?
I'm hoping that the next ice age comes soon because you ain't exactly generous on ice in my drink
"Writers, actors, ... What about us studio logos?"
No need for plastic cups.
"The doctor said the hot flashes were early menopause, but I know it's global warming."
Can I please get a water? That last drink knocked me off my axis!
"I don't mean to be rude, but, as species go, yours sucks!"
"I didn't ask for a shot; I said, ""Shoot me!"""
On the rocks please.
This glass is half empty.
"Thanks for the water, but I need something stronger."
"How would you feel, living with such an existential threat?"
What have you got that's cold
"The song says you got the whole world in your hands, but I haven't had a date in a million years."
I'd like to buy the world a drink on me.
It seems like I need a drink a lot more often these days.
It keeps getting hotter I need water!
It's getting too hot not to drink heavily.
Just leave the bottle
That's an astronomical service fee!
Do you need some ice in your drink to cool off?
My head just keeps spinning! Got anything for that?
"Hey! Really needed that seventh day off, did you?"
"Yeah, they wouldn't let me in the Macy's Parade!"
"Same old same old with me-global warming, mass extinctions, the next doomsday tech craze, all thanks to, no offense, your kind. But tell me more about how your wife has started to make her shepherd's pie with ground turkey instead of ground beef."
"Sam, it was so much easier just dealing with volcanoes, earthquakes, and dinosaurs."
So two planets came into a bar...
"So I said, fine, if you’re going to trash me, I’m just gonna go get wasted."
"And then she said I'm her whole world, but I'm everyone's whole world!"
"In the real world, sobriety is overrated."
You can keep the change!
"Can I get some ice, I'm dying over here."
I really need something cooling.
Give me a Frozen Daiquiri.
"And you think you have problems,"
It would mean the world to me for another shot.
Tough sales meeting today. I was bullied by Jupiter 'cuz I referred to Pluto as an out-of-market PLANET.
Why can't you understand that just because I'm drunk doesn't mean I have a drinking problem.
"I've had a fever, can I get some ice?"
I've spun out of control.
"Just because I’m 3/4ths water, doesn’t mean this drink should be."
He had 7 rings so she chose him.
It's not the alcohol.  I'm naturally vertiginous.
"The experts all say to drink more water, but then they told me my water levels are rising too high."
THAT LUCKY 'OLE SUN ROLLS AROUND HEAVEN WHILE I HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU GUYS!!!
"""Next round is on me"""
She left me for another planet.
"I know I'm three-fifths water, but even I need a drink now and then."
Have you seen my sun?
Pluto? The guy’s not even a planet anymore.
"I told them that crew they brought in 300,000 years ago was going to drive the place into the ground."
Isn't it normal to move to a warmer state when you get older?
We're screwed !
Why do they call me the blue planet? How much time have ya got?
There's just so much I can take.. let them go to Mars!
First I was square. Then I was 80% water. When will this end?
"A very LARGE asteroid, straight up please…"
"I just feel like nobody cares about me anymore, you know?"
Those North Korean rockets are a nuisance.
There's word out
"I've got plenty of water, but I could use more food."
I feel like I have the whole world on my shoulders!
"I'm sorry,but I'm going to have to cut you off. Floods and earthquakes while drunk just aren't funny."
Drinks for everyone on me!
"...and she said, ""Buddy, you're in a world of hurt."""
Hey !  Did you forget about me ?
Even Charlie Chaplin won't play with me anymore!
"I can’t get any sleep, there’s always a part of me going"
My populations just don't understand me.
"Bartender, what on earth is going on ?"
The problem is that none of the other planets understand me.
"I don't get it. Everyone says I'm getting hotter, but I still can't get a text back."
What if they can't stop feral swine? Or the lantern fly gets a foothold? And don't even get me started about the Emerald  ash borer! You can't get a good ash bat anymore. That's why Major  League averages are down so much. Not enough ash wood bats!
"We had a moment when you guys re-introduced wolves, but since then I’ve taken some hits."
"I just feel small.  And the hot flushes, oi!"
Close my tab. I’ve got the spins.
Have you seen my buddies Pluto and Mars?  We haven't run into each other in a long time.
"Ans so I told them, The older I get the more hot flashes I get. They still don't understand!"
"Seriously, dude?  A glass of water?  For my melting glaciers?"
Can you put some ice in it??  I'm burning up here.
"With all these hot flashes, I must be going through menopause."
… and then she says I am too into earthly pleasures…
I can feel my temperature rising.
"So I say, ""Ok mother, but a little nurture wouldn't hurt"""
God and an astrophysicist walked to a bar.....
"All the talk is terraforming Mars, colonizing the Moon, exploring the moons of Jupiter…I’m standing right here!"
"They say it's terminal, but I'm hoping they find a cure before it's too late."
"Hey, Norm, you got anything stiffer?"
Hand to God - what on Earth is going on!?
It's not my fault the ice cube keeps melting.
"I’m not flat, but this soda is"
I need another shot of Kyoto.
I'm tired of the same old orbit.
Do you ever get the feeling that things are crawling all over you?
Why is everyone angry at me? I’m just one of God’s trillions of soccer balls!
I keep getting this fever but the doctor says it's nothing.
"Would you mind freshening this up,my ice is all melting."
Seems like I can't get anything on ice anymore.
I don’t understand it. If  I ’m such a hottie how come I can’t pick up chicks?
"I love 'em to death, but my kids are killing me!"
"No, it’s not the end. I’m just a yard sale globe."
Do you know who 'Henny-Penny' is?
"I'm not smoking, I swear."
I ordered this on my rocks.
I'll have one last round for Mankind !
I'll have a gin and tectonic...my plates feel slightly askew.
"And then she says, ‘this is just a natural cycle!’ I’m so steamed!"
"The hot flashes are getting more frequent, and worse!"
Is it getting warm in here?
Make mine AlkaSeltzer
It's been a really tough year!
It’s you. Hi. You’re the problem it’s you.
Is it me or is it warm in here?”
My problems are bigger than global warming.
That was some drink! Better have all the king’s horses and all the king’s men as well as all the democracies ready…I’m going to hit the dirt.
"My fever just isn’t subsiding, and my doctor won’t see me!"
Do you want to go around the world or not?
"I am hot as hell in here,but I  hate to ask you to turn the AC down"
"I bought everybody a round, but it was flat!"
Could ya put more ice in my drink?  I really need to cool down.
"By the looks of that hairline, I see your polar icecaps are melting too"
"And, I am the weight on your shoulders."
"If my wife calls, I wasn't sphere."
I can’t take it anymore! Everyone’s telling me I’m going to hell in a hand basket!
I wish someone would take the weight of me off of me.
"Brother,do I need to cool down."
"I swear. The planet was full of water. And you were there, too, Uncle Ed."
Just pour a double over my head - - feeling uncomfortably warm
"Remember me, gorby as in Gorbychov?"
Can I get some extra ice over here?
"Hurry up, barman.  I’m getting rather thirsty around the Sahara."
Your hands big enough?
You think you've got problems!
"Why won't anyone listen to me.  Susan Hanna, Columbus, Ohio"
My uncle raped me!
"Bless me Father , I am the eye of the storm"
Another hurricane please. I need to build up my tolerance for them.
"Can I get the sustainable menu, please?"
"Hot, hot, hot and no relief in sight!"
Why is it every time I tell you about my crappy day  you tell me to cool down?
Pour me a hurricane.
You kept telling me there’d always be more fish in the sea!
"Another glass, if you don’t mind. It’s become warmer these past few decades…"
"Fusion Smusion! Just call your café ""GOOD EATS"" !"
"So then Elon says to her, ‘I’m going to give you the world.’  And we all thought he was kidding."
"You know what kind of pressure comes with that ""You mean the world to me"" crap?"
I never thought hot flashes would get this bad!
It’s my 79th day. Can’t quit now.
I am nervous; you people are not interested in reducing my temperature!
Can you start serving that giant cube?   The rocks melt too fast.
"It's not fair!  Merc & Venus don't have any.  I've got one.  Jupiter has twelve.  Even Pluto, that's not even a planet anymore, has five moons!"
"… after decades of criticizing my shape and constantly comparing my size to that of the other planets… they just decided that I am flat now, and the hottest thing in the universe…"
Could I have some more ice? Mine keeps melting.
Quarter to three...why is it only you and me?
"So I says to Venus, “Not all of us can take the heat like you.” Then she calls me a wuss. To my face! TO MY FACE!"
"I just say I'm one of the Real World's ""helpers' ...it shuts the kids right up."
Just half a shot and I feel like I'm already spinning.
"... but then Charlton Heston finds the Statue of Liberty blown up on the beach, and I tell you what, I haven't slept a full night since."
A few more edits and I tell you I’m going global.
I have some earth-shattering news!
Put me on Atlas’ tab.
"may I have more water I think mines polluted"""
"You probably don’t want to hear about the problems of the world, but…"
I ordered water on the rocks -- this is just water.
Excuse me. This water tastes a little like plastic.
And then a big asteroid hit and wiped out the dinosaurs. I tell ya man I can't take it any longer.
Sometimes it just feels like I gotta hit the Space Bar to continue.
"I dunno. One minute I'm freezing, the next I'm burning.  I'm cranky then crying. Is this what menopause is supposed to be like?"
Could you tell me which body of water this came out of? Some of it is more polluted than others.
Is this the world order?
"So the earth walks into a bar,and the bartender says"
"And then one day, I was upside down!"
global relief
"I have a question, God. Why have you infested me with humans?"
"No, my Doctors say I can't drink gasoline anymore!  They recommend a scotch and solar instead."
I get all scrambled when I have more than one.
"I can't seem to get rid of this pesky rash, so I'm trying heat"
"Hey there, can you recommend a place with a better atmosphere?"
"I can quit whenever I want, Davey."
"I said ""on the rocks."" Haven't you heard? I'm burning up."
"You think you’ve got problems, I have Homo sapien cancer ."
I'm bushed... have you seen Atlas around here?
"A glass of lemonade, just ice please.  Madeleine Boudreau Dover, MA"
Did you ever hear that song 'Forever Young'?
"Honest…I’m trying to replenish the rivers, glaciers, oceans, and my skin condition."
Last call? What in the world?!?!
I'm going through the change. The hot flashes are the worst.
I suppose it's too late to switch to a new line of work?
I'm just so tired of constant spin.
I’d like to propose a toast: A round for everyone!
Globalization is really getting to me.
You know this global warming thing seems to be draining my oceans…
So you want to talk about hoax?
I tell ya I get no respect.
"Another Dark N’ Stormy, extra stormy."
"She keeps trying to get me read ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus""..."
"I understand, my ice has been melting too"
What in the world did you put in this drink? It’s fantastic1
"Mars hasn’t been in, right, red, yay high, cold and dry, because he said one more probe and he would wring me dry."
Your special to reduce global warming anxiety--is that shaken or stirred?
It’s getting a little hot in here.  Could you please turn down the greenhouse gasses?
My problems are outta this world.
Gimme another Catastrophe with a twist of lemon!
But there are plenty of fish in ME!
What do you mean I only get one shot?
Hey I have some problems Want to hear ?
"On second thought, I’d better get a double."
Your drinks are out of this world
The world is too much with me.
I can’t stop thinking about how much poop is on me right now!
Hello! Sir? Can I get a little attention here?
Nope.  Still not happy.
"Refill, please."
Peace on it!
"Sorry, I don't mean to go on about the whole world's problems."
I have to get used to having mine neat.
I got it bad but Atlas has it worse.
"Thanks, Barkeep, but I don't think you have nearly enough time to listen."
"I dunno, Joe. Sometimes it just feels like I’m going round in circles."
"That guy Atlas was a schmuck, and then some"
See ya'  around...
Even my wife says I’m not a planet any more.
"Did you ever feel like the whole world was on your shoulders?"""
"Wait, are you all drinking this filtered?"
May I please have a drink large enough to reverse my aquifer depletion?
It won't be long now.
And just like that they left me
Cut me off! I feel like I’m spinning!
Take my strife - Please!
"They want me to solve the world's problems, can you believe it?"
Please gimme some ice with this!
I'm getting more and more of these hot flashes these days. Something's not right.
"Excuse me, I asked for 71% water"
It's only half full.
"Oh, just try to tell me about hot flashes!"
I’ve got the whole world on my shoulders.
"Here I am, over 70% of me covered with water — and still my glass is only half full!"
"Hi Joe,got a lot stories I want you to know."
"Some ice, please - I need to cool down."
"I know it doesn’t look like I need it, but I’m only made of 3% freshwater."
And then it hit me...it's bar stools all the way down.
Day after day spinning around...
"I don't care whether the glass is half full or half empty; the beer has just gone flat, and everything else seems to be going wrong."
And then they insisted I could only have carbon cocktails!
I’ve really been having a lot of hot flashes lately! Do you think I’m menopausal?
Does a flush beat a full house ?
"This may sound off the wall, but I'm not feeling quite together."
It's on my shoulders...
I'm trying as hard as I can but the micro-organisms just won't let up.
Is it just me or has the whole world gone crazy?
"Yea, well, I’ve been here before but man, this really ramped up fast this time!"
"This Fireball is on the house,"" said the bar tender... as he loved to watch the world burn"
"Quick, 'tender, pour me a cold one! I'm overheating."
"I swear, I have more problems than anyone."
I'm feeling feverish. Got some ice?
"And then I realised, it's just circles, you know?"
Poor me! poor me! pour me another!
But I was told you could solve all of my problems.
Do you know of a good designated driver or something like that ?  That Atlas guy quit on me.
"And then she says, 'I'm tired of carrying your weight on my shoulders. I want a divorce!'"
"Listen, being on shoulders all day is no picnic either."
Nobody loves me.
"So I swear to God,the guy comes up to me and says I thought you was flat so I says to him who are you calling flat so you know what he says to me he says why I oughtta’ so you know what I said to him I says you big ugly lug for two stinking cents I…."
"I tell ya, it never stops. They just keep turning up the heat on me."
I’m on fire.  Keep dousing me.
"I was the center of her universe until Copernicus. … Well, everyone’s. But only she was the center of mine."
Im starting to think I have a problem.  Michael Riley
SINCE GLOBAL WARMING KICKED IN I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH FLUIDS!
I feel like I've been used while my own needs have been cast aside.  Thanks for listening to my story -- noone else seems to care.
"If I start falling, don't grab me by the South Pole"
My water levels are rising. Make my next one neat.
"If you really want to address climate change, give me something strong enough to get me off my axis."
"So, bartender, the sun is dying. Never again will I hitch my wagon to a star!"
"Another shot of bourbon,sir! Might as well end this with a bang not a whimper."
"It's scary out there, trust me."
Then she said I was flatter in person
Hey! I had a fight with my axis and now she's my ex.
That last Super Blue Moon just did me in!
You think you've got it bad?  I've got the whole world on my shoulders!
Earth to barkeep I need a drink fast
"He just had me there, in his hands."
Why so down today?
Now think about maintaining a 71% hydration level.
How do you expect me to manage the climate when I have one eye stuck in the ocean?
"Earth to bartender, I’m telling you my problems here."
"I get the chills, then I'm burning alive, man.  I tell you . . ."
Some days I just feel like I've been shrugged off!
"Sure, I've got the hydrogen and the nitrogen, but this place? There's real atmosphere."
"and then, there's that guy who thinks he has me on his shoulders"
My human inhabitants don't understand me.
"I'm not an alcoholic! These fires in California are making me thirsty, okay?"
Why isn't God saving me?
"No matter how hard I try, I just don’t blend in."
I'd like a water chaser please
"And after all that,  she tells me I'm too warm."
"Excuse me sir, I asked for a cosmo not the Cosmos."
I've been feeling a bit wobbly lately!
"Oh, fuck!"
"Joe, I’m tellin’ ya, I’m throwin’ in the towel."
Y'know that high ball I asked for? I'm finally here.
"Hey, pal, my weight is none of your business."
Sorry about the bald joke...with all this heat I'm getting a little salty.
"Doesn't seem to matter how close I get to the sun, they still keep producing that darn CO2."
Can I still get a Long Island Iced Tea or is that just saltwater on the rocks?
And then Neptune said…
Could I get some ice?
Help me out here. Do I have Weltschmerz  or Schadenfreude?
"I’ll have another, even though the administration and the world says things are great…I think I’ll drink to that anyway…"
Carbonated water... seriously?
I think I have too many toxic friends! They don’t stop spewing garbage!
So these two fossil fuels walk into a bar...
"Sure, your place isn't all that it's cracked up to be, but I feel right at home here."
You don’t understand… She was my whole world!
I miss the simple times when everyone thought I was flat.
And then you guys came along. Sheesh!
And then he said we should burn more beautiful clean coal.
I’m overheated. Can I have some ice?
So you are gonna charge me for the water!
"Yes, I know I look like I got the weight of the world on my shoulders...because I DO!!""  Maureen W Philadelphia, P"
I asked for a full proof solution. All I got was melted ice.
How Many Days Would it take to Sail around the World ?
"Help! I think I swallowed England! 'Can't you trump it out?' No sir, let's try the heimlich."
But why pick on me? It’s not like I’m the only planet around.
"Can you get them to stop saying ""This round's on me.""?"
"Last call?!  Uh, yeah!  Hello?!  You have a chaser to go with that shot of tragic irony that I don't recall ordering, wise guy?  Let me just leave you a well-deserved tip of poetic justice and zero sense."
"C’mon, Glenn, I’m perfectly fine! It’s just that everyone *else* is tilted over 23.5 degrees…"
"Hey, d'ya think that just one drink will calm me down?"
"I swear, they must hate me."
My wife is cheating on me with Mars.
Problems…problems..problems
"I just got the word from on high, she’s fed up and ready to start over again; find yourself a boat or learn to snorkel for forty days."
Can't ya see my hand is up fifteen minutes ago?
Make the next one a double. The heat outside is killing me.
Sigh! And how am I supposed to move to another planet?
"I asked for rocks, no salt."
Yes. A stiff barrel !!!. I’m beyond fill er up!!
Where in the World am I? I ask!
Make it a double; the election season is beginning early.
You don't know what it's like out there!
Hold the water chaser!
I've got problems. Leave the bottle.
Globalzation? Internationalism? Transnationalism? It's too complex!
I'm boiling! More oil!
I’m really not that small.
Then Elon got angry and challenged me to a duel !!
"I tell ya, I don't get no respect !!!!!!!!!"
Did you ever feel like you had the weight of the world on your shoulders?
It's flat.
Wish you were here.
"Not much, what about you?"
"My wife's a pain in the ass. She's always busting my friggin' agates, my daughter's married to a jadrool loser bastard, and I got a rash so bad on my ass, I can't even sit down. But you know me. I can't complain."
"And then they say, *hick* they say, they want to leave me for more resources!"
Can I have a double?
This drink is 71% water.
It's a first-world problem.
Don’t let the door hit you in the butt on your way out.
I’ve hot nowhere to go.
I am seventy percent water. So straight up next time.
What do mean my tab is almost full?
"I'm telling you, no one understands me."
"Listen to me, things are going to get bad. -Alicia Chinatomby, Los Angeles, CA"
You think you've got problems? I feel like I carry the weight of the world around all day!
It's feeling a little warm in here. Could you turn up the AC?
"Well, for 76 years I was the ninth planet..."
"Hard choice, do I die in glacial waters or with vodka?"
"...so then I tried to tell them 'it's getting hot in here,' but that just made them party harder!"
Got a thermometer?
Can you make the next one a bit stronger? I'm 75% water?
"Close my tab, any more and I’ll be spinning off my axis!"
"‘I don’t appreciate a watered down drink. I’m already 70% water.’  Mira Dragisic  Elmhurst, Illinois"
What do you mean i’m shut off?
"Believe me, Atlas doesn’t do ALL the worrying."
"So I told her, you really brighten my days."
"So I said ""sun, darling, why does everything always has to revolve around you!"""
"Hey, you got any damp-rid??"
I think this could be the year for the Titans.
Oy!  If only you knew my troubles.
Dad the voices are trying to wake the dinosaurs again.
I swear. It's not my fault your hot tub is cooler than the Atlantic!
I’m way too hot!  But everybody acts like they’re deaf when I tell them they gotta help me cool off.
I'm trying pasteurization for the 2 legged parasites
I think I need an enema to crap out all the plastic debris in my system.
Can I get some pi to go?
"I said ""ON THE ROCKS!"" forPete's sake..."
And now they're saying that global warming is my fault!
Things aren't so bad. I can count the number of my mass extinctions on one hand.
I’m done! I don’t get no respect anymore.
Make mine a double!
Can you believe that they said that I was full of hot air?
I'm going to hell in a hand basket. Make it a double.
"Another one, Joe, but more ice.  Can't take this heat!"
"Okay, so I get a little hot under the collar."
Maybe it is the end of the world !
Could I have a glass of water. I’m overheating and need to hydrate.
"The weight of the world is on my shoulders, and I don’t have any!"
"Yeah, I agree. It's going to be a hot one."
"Boy, it was a lot cooler last time I went around the sun!"
I'm running out of fresh water!
I’m going to need a lot more than this……
Waiter! Waiter! More microplastics please!
"Doc says it's ""climate change"". I thought it was the flu!"
"I only have a drink once in a blue moon,what's wrong with that?"
Can you ask your boss to “turn the heat down”?
"It’s like cheap vodka, I am burning inside."
I like my water sparkling with a side of salt.
"So then Jupiter says 'I got 69 moons and you only got one, so I says..."
Really small planets get no respect.
Hasta la vista baby!
Set 'em up. I'm going to need lotsa drinks.
You got any aspirin?  I think I'm running a fever.
"Can I urgently have more ice, please?"
"I can smell your cunt, David Remnick."
"Listen buddy, I don't want it on the rocks."
I figured you'd come to me sooner or later. Take a sip while I put on my white skull cap and mitre.
Some days I just wanna say “Enough already with the spinning!”
What can I do?  The world's going to hell in a hand basket!
To be honest I only come in here to get out of the heat.
"This is my last round, close me out."
If I have another you’ll have to roll me home
Have you ever been accused of cruelty?
I have no complaints.
I just wished the me revolved around me…
You take them...I need a break!
Do think global warming is the reason for my hot flashes or am I simply going through menopause?
How about throwing a couple of Hail Marys my way?
I don’t get it. One day they’re saying nice things about me and the next day I don’t get no respect.
I’ll have a shot of fireball and make jt strong
YOU say you've heard it all!
Why did you skimp on the ice?  I told you I was getting hot!
"The doc said I don't have much time, but I think if I just wait it out, it'll go away. No matter which way it goes, I'll miss our talks."
Please don't listen to those young earthers! I swear I'm old enough!
"I'm warming, Lou!  Start me off with a billion frozen daiquiris, and keep 'em coming."
They care more about staying in power than about me.
Quick! Before it's too late!
"I'm feeling warm, I need a cool drink."
I’ve only got a few minutes…My O-zone meter is running up.
"Yeah, I'm weary! Wouldn't be sitting here if I weren't."
"....so then my wife says she wants a divorce and that our marriage has been a ""hell on earth""."
"So then I said, ""You have no idea what it's like to have the weight of the world on your shoulders."""
Are you my Uber driver?
I'll be fine. Being 70% water is key for preventing hangovers.
Stop the me! I want to get off.
This guy tried to pick me up and when I said I'd never heard of him -- Elon Musk -- he just lost it!
Don't get started on the people who think I owe them something. I was here first.
"Ok God, can I now try the artificial intelligence shot?"
One drink will never make me feel better.
Please.  Your tallest glass of atmosphere on the rocks.
"So I told her, ""Air travel isn't making me smaller, but it IS making me hotter,"" and she threw me out of the house!"
Another water please. It’s like I’m made (mostly) of water.
"Yes, it's Weltsmerz!"
I am beginning to regret this whole adoption thing
"If you had 8 billion bugs dermaforming you, you’d drink too"
"Why is your roasted appetizer called ""The Preview?"""
I feel like I got the weight of the world on my shoulders
Do you ever feel like a piece of you is missing? And is in constant orbit around you causes high tides?
"No ice ?” LD Soderlind, Mpls,M"
"And then they made me change. Dressed me up in plastic and rubbed oil all over me. Why? I liked me just the way I was--originally, I mean."
"So I said, ""You can't keep me spinning around you forever!"" and ever since leaving, I'm just so lost."
I'm doomed! Mars refused to trade places.
Where's the can? This climate change has wreaked havoc on my sea levels.
Is it too much to ask for just a little respect?
"I met a nice fella named Jupiter,but he"
