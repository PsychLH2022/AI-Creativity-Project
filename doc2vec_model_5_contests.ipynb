    "The goal of this analysis is to show an alternative method to create caption embeddings or vectors compared to using a pretrained Sentence-Bert model. I will use the term embeddings and vectors interchangeably. By capturing embeddings for captions in multiple contests, we can use these to infer on what makes a caption funny. To create vectors, I will use an algorithm called Doc2Vec which generates vectors for each individual caption. The data is grabbed from our SQL database in which the data was collected from https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data/. In this notebook, I will use data from 5 contests since this version is used for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of this analysis is to load in the relevant libraries and pull down data from the SQL database in which the next two blocks do. I am using the gensim package for preprocessing and topic modeling which is an open source Python library representing documents as semantic vectors, as efficiently and painlessly as possible. It is designed to process raw, unstructured digital texts (“plain text”) using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This is the fastest library for natural language processing and it is easy to use and understand. Next, I am requesting a connection to the SQL database by using a Python package called mysql.connector which allows Python progams to have access to SQL databases. The database I am pulling down information from is called new york cartoon."

Preprocessing of text before any form of analysis is very important because it can remove noise such as unnecessary punctuation which contain no meaning. It also allows us to homogenize all the words through lowercasing them. Having uppercase letters might cause variation in how the text is analyzed which can cause different results in our embeddings. Apparently, the values in the column are classified as objects when they should be strings, so I will convert them to strings before performing preprocessing. Here, I am creating a new column called \"caption_processed\" because I want to see how the text changes once we have finished our preprocessing for clarity purposes.
