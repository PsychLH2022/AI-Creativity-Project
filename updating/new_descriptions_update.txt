This update has no code.
To update future cartoon contest descriptions in the database, the workflow will involve two AI models: the llava model and ChatGPT-4. 
These models will generate descriptions for the cartoons of new contests. 
Once these descriptions are available, a project team member needs to manually insert both descriptions into the "new_descriptions" table in the database. 
This process will be used for each new cartoon contest, starting with contest number 878 as the initial example.
